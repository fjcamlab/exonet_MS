# ExoNet - MS/MS analysis

Alignment and statistical analysis of LC/ESI-MS/MS data from human PDAC subpopulations.

## Project description

Characterization of the protein composition of exosomes and cells of five distinct subpopulations from four human PDAC cell lines (BxPC-3, PANC-1, T3M4, and MIA PaCa-2), via liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI–MS/MS). 

Independent Data Acquisition (IDA) using Analyst TF 1.7 software from a Triple TOF 5600 System (SCIEX, USA). The data were processed using PeakView® 2.2 Software (SCIEX, Foster City, CA), and MS-GF+ software (https://github.com/MSGFPlus/msgfplus) as a search engine.

## Data availability

The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD023529 and 10.6019/PXD023529.
