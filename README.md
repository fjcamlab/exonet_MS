# ExoNet - MS/MS analysis

Alignment and statistical analysis of LC/ESI-MS/MS data from human PDAC subpopulations.

# Project description
Characterization of the protein composition of exosomes and cells of five subpopulations (CD24-CD44+, CD24+CD44+, EpCAM+, CD133+, negative for all markers) from four human PDAC cell lines (BxPC-3, PANC-1, T3M4, and MIA PaCa-2), via liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESIâ€“MS/MS).
